### MVP

User will be able to search for a specific effect pedal to see what gear the musicians used on it

#### MVP EXAMPLE:
- searchable DB of songs, effect pedals, and guitarists
- users can log in to add their own pedals 
- aside menu contains information about the different effects
- clean and streamlined apperance

### Post-MVP

- ability to search by pedals or songs. admin credentials for certain users to update and delete pedals from the db

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE:
- multi-faceted search (pedal, song, artist)



### MVP Server (Back End)

#### ERD Model

- GET `/pedals`
	- Index route showing all searched pedals. 
- GET `/pedals/:id`
	- Show route for a pedal by ID

- GET `/songs/:id`
	- Show route for a song by ID
- POST `/addpedal`
	- Create route for user to add pedal to the db

- Rails - Back End
- Axios - Getting back end data


## Issues and Resolutions

The main issue I am anticipating is the sheer volume of data that I'll need to put in for this to be a "completed" project. I anticipate putting in ~10-15 pedals and songs, but if I actually want to deploy this and sent it into the community for use, it will need substantially more (30-40 pedals and >50 songs).

Biggest issues were in Updating on the Front End, and connecting the Front and Back Ends for C, U, and D functions
